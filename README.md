# Is Node Red Down ?? <br>

Just a simple web app that sees if our Internship's IBM Bluemix's Node Red server is down or not and reflects so to the user. Additionally there is a server api reached by  /status that gives either true if down or false if not down.<br> <br>

Inspired by the popular office phrase <b>"Is Node Red down again ??"  </b> , well now you can check ;)
